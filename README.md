## SimuDrift
By: Luis Rodrigo Arce-Vald√©s (01-30-22)

### Introduction
SimuDrift.py is a simple genetic drift simulator python 3.0 script. This program creates plots of simulations of changes in allelic frequencies across generations as a function of initial effective population size and initial allelic frequencies. The program assumes a Fisher-Wright-like closed population of haploid organisms with non-overlapping generations, mutations or natural selection.

### Instalation
Simply download the `SimuDrift.py` script and run it via a Unix terminal using:
```
python SimuDrift.py
```

For Windows users I found [this tutorial ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qi28uPKaH_A) explaining how to use Python.

### Usage
After running the script, the program will automatically ask the user for the input of the following parameters:
1. **Number of A1 alleles in the population**. These are the alleles that the program track their relative frequency.
2. **Number of A2 alleles in the population**. The frequency of this other alleles are easily estimated as: q = 1 - p.
3. **Number of generations**. For how many generations will the program run?
4. **Number of simulations**. How many simulations will the program do?

All of these parameters **must** be inputed as an integer higher than 0 for the program to run!

### Enjoy
